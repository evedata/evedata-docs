## Setup

You must have [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed. To install uv:

```sh
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

You must also have the following packages: cairo, freetype, libffi, libjpeg, libpng, and zlib. If you use Homebrew, a [Brewfile](https://github.com/corvinvale/evedata-guide/blob/main/Brewfile) is provided to install them:

```sh
brew bundle
```

You must have Node.js 22+ installed in order to deploy the site. Node.js can be installed with [Volta](https://volta.sh/). To install Volta, Node.js, and the required NPM packages:

```sh
curl https://get.volta.sh | bash
volta install node@22
npm install
```

## Development

Run a local development server:

```sh
uv run mkdocs serve
```

This starts a server that will be accessible via <http://localhost:8000> in your browser. Any changes made within the project will automatically reload any browser tabs.
